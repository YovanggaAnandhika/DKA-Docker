# Welcome to the chrony configuration file. See chrony.conf(5) for more
# information about usable directives.

# This will use (up to):
# - 4 sources from ntp.ubuntu.com which some are IPv6 enabled
# - 2 sources from 2.ubuntu.pool.ntp.org which is IPv6 enabled as well
# - 1 source from [01].ubuntu.pool.ntp.org each (IPv4 only atm)
# This means by default, up to 6 dual-stack and up to 2 additional IPv4-only
# sources will be used.
# At the same time, it retains some protection against one of the entries being
# down (compare to just using one of the lines).
